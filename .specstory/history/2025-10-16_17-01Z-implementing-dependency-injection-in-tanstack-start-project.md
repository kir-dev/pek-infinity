# Implementing dependency injection in TanStack Start project (2025-10-16 17:01Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 17:04Z)**_



GitHub Copilot coding agent wasnt enabled on that repo, so I forked it.
Please read the whole conversation history from this file

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-haiku-4.5)**_

I've read through the chat history. Here's my understanding of what you need:

## Summary

You're working on a **TanStack Start full-stack TypeScript monorepo** migrating from Vite (CSR) + Nest.js. The goal is to:

1. **Clean up the TanStack Start starter template** — keep useful code, reorganize, remove dead code
2. **Implement NestJS-style dependency injection** using `tsyringe` with:
   - `PrismaService` (request-scoped, extends PrismaClient)
   - Injectable services with `@injectable()` and `@inject()` decorators
   - `injectService()` middleware for lazy/deferred service resolution
   - `authGuard(scopes)` middleware for authentication, scope checking, Prisma registration, and cleanup
3. **Ensure type-safe, per-request service access** via `ctx.service` in server handlers
4. **Validate with tests/builds** post-changes

## Key Constraints

- **Only edit files in the `` folder** unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer NestJS DI patterns over FastAPI
- Avoid hallucinated service names; suggest based on actual project needs
- Use `tsyringe` + `reflect-metadata` for DI

## Next Steps

To get started, I need to:

1. **Explore the project structure** — what's in ``? (routes, services, components, integrations)
2. **Understand the current starter setup** — what demo code exists that should be cleaned up?
3. **Clarify service design** — what specific services should I implement? (e.g., UserService, ProfileService, etc.)

Would you like me to **start by examining the `` folder structure** to assess what needs cleanup and where to implement the DI system?

your response is not detailed enough. print the examples I gave to you. add more details.
Also load the context7 tanstack router into the context window. You can find the keywords in the chat history.

After that dont say anything, just wait for my next instruction

### **Example Implementation from Chat History (Final Version):**

```ts
import 'reflect-metadata'
import { container, injectable, inject } from 'tsyringe'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const SCOPE = {
  USER_VIEW_PROFILE: 'USER_VIEW_PROFILE',
  USER_EDIT_PROFILE: 'USER_EDIT_PROFILE',
} as const

// -------------------- PrismaService --------------------
@injectable()
export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient {}

// -------------------- Services --------------------
@injectable()
export class SA_additional {
  sayHello() {
    return 'hello from SA_additional'
  }
}

@injectable()
export class SA {
  constructor(
    @inject(PrismaService) private prisma: PrismaService,
    @inject(SA_additional) private extra: SA_additional,
  ) {}

  async editUserProfile(body: { name: string }) {
    const msg = this.extra.sayHello()
    await this.prisma.$connect()
    return { message: `${msg}, profile updated for ${body.name}` }
  }
}

@injectable()
export class SB {
  constructor(@inject(PrismaService) private prisma: PrismaService) {}
  async somethingElse() {
    return 'did something else'
  }
}

// -------------------- Middleware --------------------
export type RequestContext = {
  prisma?: PrismaService
  service?: any
  pendingServiceClass?: any
  user?: { id: string; scopes: string[] }
}

// Lazy DI: resolve or defer
export function injectService<T>(ServiceClass: new (...args: any[]) => T) {
  return async (ctx: RequestContext, next: () => Promise<any>) => {
    let try1Error: unknown = null

    try {
      ctx.service = container.resolve(ServiceClass)
      return await next()
    } catch (err) {
      try1Error = err
      ctx.pendingServiceClass = ServiceClass
      Object.defineProperty(ctx, 'service', {
        configurable: true,
        get() {
          throw new Error(
            `Service ${ServiceClass.name} cannot be accessed before initialization`
          )
        },
        set(value) {
          Object.defineProperty(ctx, 'service', {
            value,
            writable: true,
            configurable: true,
          })
        },
      })
    }

    try {
      await next()
      if (ctx.pendingServiceClass) {
        throw new Error(`Pending service ${ServiceClass.name} was never resolved`)
      }
    } catch (try2Error) {
      console.error('Initial resolve failed:', try1Error)
      throw try2Error
    }
  }
}

// -------------------- AuthGuard --------------------
export function authGuard(requiredScopes: string[]) {
  return async (ctx: RequestContext, next: () => Promise<any>) => {
    ctx.user = { id: '123', scopes: [SCOPE.USER_EDIT_PROFILE, SCOPE.USER_VIEW_PROFILE] }
    const hasAll = requiredScopes.every(s => ctx.user!.scopes.includes(s))
    if (!hasAll) throw new Error('Forbidden')

    const prisma = new PrismaService()
    container.registerInstance(PrismaService, prisma)
    ctx.prisma = prisma

    if (ctx.pendingServiceClass) {
      ctx.service = container.resolve(ctx.pendingServiceClass)
      delete ctx.pendingServiceClass
    }

    await next()
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  }
}

export const Route = createFileRoute('/

stop!

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-haiku-4.5)**_

Understood. I've loaded the TanStack Router and tsyringe documentation into the context window. I'm ready and waiting for your next instruction.

_**User (2025-10-16 17:16Z)**_

When I previously used the delegate to copilot coding agent tool, you only gave it a too short instruction. That agent doesnt have access to this conversation, so you need to be detailed.
I want you to think about what will you add in your request this time. Remember that this tool uses models with 200k context window.

Don't print the full request, just hashtags, summaries (eg I will include the example implementation of a service) to me.

# Plan for Detailed Copilot Coding Agent Request

## Key Sections to Include:

- **#project-context** — Monorepo migration from Vite+Nest.js to TanStack Start; tight frontend-backend coupling; component folder architecture; NestJS DI patterns

- **#architecture-principles** — Frontend (components + hooks + local types); Backend (services with @Inject); DRY rule (5+ repetitions); per-request service lifetimes

- **#current-status** — TanStack Start autogenerated template; services prepared; Prisma integration via middleware needed; migration focuses on type safety

- **#di-system-requirements** — tsyringe + reflect-metadata; PrismaService (extends PrismaClient); injectService() middleware (lazy resolve + defer); authGuard(scopes) middleware (auth + scope check + Prisma registration + cleanup); type-safe ctx.service; per-request lifecycle

- **#example-implementation** — Full working code block showing: PrismaService, injectable services, RequestContext type, injectService() middleware with error handling, authGuard() middleware with deferred resolution, route handler demonstrating middleware chain

- **#tanstack-router-context7-docs** — Key concepts: server handlers, middleware execution order, context passing via next({context}), beforeLoad hooks, createFileRoute patterns

- **#constraints** — Only edit /full-stack folder unless necessary; avoid hallucinated service names (suggest based on actual project needs); prefer NestJS over FastAPI DI patterns

- **#clarifications-needed** — Which starter demo routes/components to keep vs remove? Specific service names needed? How global middleware registration works in TanStack Start?

- **#validation** — Tests/builds must pass post-changes; verify DI resolution, middleware execution, Prisma lifecycle, scope checking

- **#coding-guidelines** — Follow .github/copilot-instructions.md; respect project linting (Biome); verify all actions; ask for clarification on ambiguous requests

clarifications section: do not explicitly answer this to the coding agent. It will figure it out. 2.: there isnt. Add authguard for each controllers outer middleware section. validation: yes, clone the tests from backend. Skip the whole coding-guidelines section, this agent is autonomous and the guidelines were created for human interaction. print the key sections again
